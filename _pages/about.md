I'm an aspiring Data Scientist from Chicago, Illinois with a passion for analytics - from cleaning and visualizing data to machine learning
and everything in between. I recently finished a Master's Degree in Predictive Analytics from DePaul University in Chicago while working as an analylst
in housing finance, as well as compling a Data Science internship with TransUnion. Nothing fascinates me more than taking a raw dataset and a problem 
and finding insights and solutions.

In my spare time I enjoy playing guitar, cycling, and travelling the world with my wife (when time allows)
