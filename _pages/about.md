I'm an aspiring Data Scientist from Chicago, Illinois with a passion for analytics - from cleaning and visualizing data to machine learning
and everything in between. I recently finished a Master's Degree in Predictive Analytics from DePaul University in Chicago
while working as an analylst in housing finance, and more recently completed a Data Science internship with TransUnion working with large 
datasets in the digital marketing sphere. I have a broad interest in data and love exploring new concepts in machine learning, data visualization,
and data mining.

In my spare time I enjoy coffee, playing guitar, cycling, and travelling the world with my wife (when time allows)
